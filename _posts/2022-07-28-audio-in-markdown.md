How can you embed audio in Markdown or HTML? It's fairly simple, as it relies on some of the same tagging for videos and images. 

Markdown supports audio inclusion for a variety of standard file formats. In this case, let's use an .mp3. You'll notice that it looks shockingly similar to an image tag.

For html, on the other hand, the process is very similar to obtaining embed codes for videos. The simplest way is to find the audio you're looking for on an audio sharing sight (or host it yourself through github or another site) and obtain the embed code, usually by right clicking or hitting the share button.

Like the video embed codes we looked at before, it includes some directions on how to size the player window, which you can edit if you see fit.
